    <h2>a little About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm a huge nerd - both self described and societally prescribed - and a large symptom of that is my love of roleplaying games and strategy games.</p>
        <p>Dungeons and dragons espeically is a huge love of mine, around 8th grade or so a group of guys in my youth group took me under their wing and taught me the game. This started a hobby that's lasted me all the way through high school and into college, and it's something that's absolutely enraptured me.</p>
        <p>This has also tied in super well with my love of creation and tinkering, and one thing that I've especially found joy in is homebrewing new content. I have notebooks filled with ideas, and I've made tons of custom content on <a href="dndbeyond.com">dndbeyond</a> for my party and whoever is interested.</p>
        <p>Now though, I want a place to tinker with and store things where people can access it and to hopefully drive interest in my little projects. I'm going to add another subtab to my site with all of my D&amp;D and other RPG stuff, especially when the thing is somewhat small, like one little rule change that can't be uploaded to dndbeyond and would be waaay to much hastle to put into a handmade book or rule collection. Plus, refrencing it to players is so much harder if it's in a book. This way anyone can access it and it's availible for me to edit.</p>
