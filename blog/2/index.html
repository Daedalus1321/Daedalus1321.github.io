    <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm a huge nerd - both self described and societally prescribed - and a large symptom of that is my love of roleplaying games and strategy games.</p>
        <p>Dungeons and dragons espeically is a huge love of mine, around 8th grade or so a group of guys in my youth group took me under their wing and taught me the game. This started a hobby that's lasted me all the way through high school and into college, and it's something that's absolutely enraptured me.</p>
        <p>This has also tied in super well with my love of creation and tinkering, and one thing that I've especially found joy in is homebrewing new content. I have notebooks filled with ideas, and I've made tons of custom content on <a href="dndbeyond.com">dndbeyond</a> for my party and whoever is interested.</p>
        <p>Now though, I want a place to tinker with and store things for people can access to hopefully drive interest. I'm going to add another subtab to my site with all of my D&amp;D and other RPG stuff.</p>
        <p>Especially when the thing is somewhat small, like one little rule that can't be uploaded to dndbeyond and would be waaay to much hastle to put into a book.</p>
