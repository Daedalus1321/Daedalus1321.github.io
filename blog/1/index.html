    <p>First off, I apologize for the incredibly dramatic title. While it may seem at first glance that this will be an incredibly well thought out, heavily researched, peer reviewed paper full and deep insight and global impact, you'll be sorely disappointed. However, I believe it is actually a benefit to my point that this is just a blog post by a college student instead of an expert of some kind.</p>
    
    <p>To begin, let's lay some important groundwork.</p>
    
    <p>Language is the primary way that we communicate about ideas, feelings, and the world around us. However, the primary motivators and methods are completely reliant on who is speaking, who they're speaking to, and to what end. Differences in any of these factors can lead to wildly different experiences with language, and this is oftentimes the main reason for conflict in the world.</p>
    
    <p>A classic example for this is the word "chips" in English. In the United States, this word means potatoes thinly sliced  into discs, fried until crispy, and often flavored with some variety of seasonings. In England, however, this word refers to potatoes cut into long rectangular strips, salted, and then fried until golden brown, sometimes eaten with a dipping sauce. A person unaware of this difference will soldier on like normal, likely experiencing some minor disappointment and frustration.</p>
    
    <p>This example, while quite mundane and minor, clearly demonstrates the first basis to my point: <b>Minor differences in languages can lead to breakdowns in society.</b></p>
    
    <p>However, these differences by themselves aren't a bad thing. Sometimes different places in time and space create the same thing with different names - or different things with the same name - and before very recently in history, it was impossible to know about anything beyond your limited experience of the world.</p>
