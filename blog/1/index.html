    <h1>Blog Post 1 - 2024/12/24</h1>
        <p>First blog post, still deciding how I want to use it.</p>
    <h2>What</h2>
	    <p>My plan for this website is for it to be a hodgepodge of my thoughts, ideas, projects, etc...</p>
	    <p>I'm going to add tabs for reviews for things I like, blog posts, projects of mine, and any random nonsense I feel like putting in</p>
    <h2>Why</h2>
        <p>Who knows? i guess I like having somewhat of an internet presence, plus I'm a student getting a computer science degree, so it feels somewhat mandatory</p>
    <p><br>It's unlikely I'll post for a while, so we'll see</p>
