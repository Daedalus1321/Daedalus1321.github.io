    <h1>1 - FIRST POST (Original)- 2024/12/24</h1>
        <p>First blog post, still feeling out how I want to use this website or if I even need a blog.</p>
    <h2>What</h2>
	    <p>My plan for this website is for it to be a hodgepodge of my thoughts, ideas, projects, etc...</p>
	    <p>I'm going to add tabs for reviews for things I like, blog posts, projects of mine, and any random nonsense I feel like putting in</p>
    <h2>Why</h2>
        <p>Who knows? I like having an internet presence, plus I'm a student getting a computer science degree, so it feels almost mandatory</p>
        <p>I also think it's a great way to organize my thoughts and learn new skills.</p>

        <p>Asher's note: I'm not going to edit the style of this page, so its a time capsule of when I wrote it!</p>
